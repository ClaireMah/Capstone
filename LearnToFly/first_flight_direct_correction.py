#your turn : uncomment each paragraph one by one and see the effect to answer to the following questions :

# I want to go up with my drone, which parameter do I have to use on the fly_direct function ? to go up use vertical_movement with a positive value only for example : SEE PARAGRAPH SIX

#I want to go on the right with my drone, which parameter do I have to use on the fly_direct function ? use roll SEE PARAGRAPH FOUR

#I want to move forward with my drone, which parameter do I have to use on the fly_direct function ? use pitch SEE PARAGRAPH ONE

#Now I want to go backward, which value do I have to enter for the previous parameter ? use pitch with a negative value SEE PARAGRAPH TWO

#I want my drone to do a 90Â° turn on the right, which function do I have to use ? use the turn_degrees function SEE PARAGRAPH THREE

#I want my drone to spin, which parameter do I have to use on the fly_direct function ? use yaw SEE PARAGRAPH FIVE
