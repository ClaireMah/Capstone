#your turn : uncomment each paragraph one by one and see the effect on the drone to answer to the following questions:

#!!!! DO NOT COMMENT/UNCOMMENT ligne 25 AND 55. Otherwise, either your drone won't take off or land.!!!

# I want to go up with my drone, which parameter do I have to use on the fly_direct function ?
#I want to go on the right with my drone, which parameter do I have to use on the fly_direct function ?
#I want to move forward with my drone, which parameter do I have to use on the fly_direct function ?
#Now I want to go backward, which value do I have to enter for the previous parameter ?
#I want my drone to do a 90Â° turn on the right, which function do I have to use ?
#I want my drone to spin, which parameter do I have to use on the fly_direct function ?
